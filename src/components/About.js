            <p>

              <i>Webster's Dictionaries</i> combined, but don't fear! We are
              here to explain tax laws as simply as possible. Though the
              dynamics of tax law is constantly changing, LernTax is your one

            <h5>How We Do It</h5>
            <p>
              We know that ignorance of tax law is not about intelligence,
              rather, it's a symptom of a lack of exposure. Tax time only shows
              up once every year after all! We have tax professionals designing
              this website to make your understanding as simple as possible.
